# 🧠 Total Recall - Memory Vacation System 🧠

Welcome to **Total Recall**, the premier provider of luxurious and totally real memory vacations! Why travel when you can just *think* you did? In this repo, you'll find everything you need to deploy your very own *Total Recall* Memory Vacation service. Spoiler: It's totally NOT based on the OWASP Juice Shop App in disguise… or is it? You’ll never know once we’re done tweaking your memory. 😎

## 🚀 About

At **Total Recall**, we sell memories of vacations you’ve never taken. Want to climb Mars’ highest peak? Done. Prefer sipping margaritas in a tropical utopia that doesn’t exist? No problem. Whether you're a secret agent, a corporate drone, or something in between, we’ve got you covered (well, your memories at least).

In this repo, you'll be spinning up a fully functional **Memory Vacation Service**. Of course, *legally* we need to let you know this is just a web app designed for security training… but who reads disclaimers anyway?

## 🤯 Features

- 🛠 **Choose Your Reality:** Select your dream vacation package with a slick UI that may or may not have more bugs than Mars.
- 🔐 **Security Holes You Can Drive a Shuttle Through:** Train your hacking skills while imagining you’re breaking into a Martian mining colony.
- 🛒 **Buy the Experience, Not the Ticket:** Purchase vacation packages with your life savings and a pinch of regret.
- 🤖 **Meet Quaid's Doppelganger:** There’s a slight chance you'll uncover memories of someone else’s secret agent missions. We swear it’s normal.
